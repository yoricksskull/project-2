The BashFastFash (BFF) Chrome Extension:
Un-greenwashing your favorite fast fashion stores with radical transparency.

greenwashing, v.: (from "whitewashing") using the color green or other environment-themed signifiers in an intentionally misleading way to market and sell products that are not in fact environmentally safe

fast fashion, n.: an expedited design, manufacturing, and shipping process that rapidly produces mass amounts of cheap clothing in response to most recent trends

This extension was created with the intent to lift the veil on the human impact of simply clicking and buying a fast fashion clothing item. There is a massive environmental and labor impact of designing an item the moment the trend hits, manufacturing it, selling it on a site, and shipping it across the world on an increasingly crunched timeline.
